MUN people are gone. Games. Oracle number game. There are numbers from 1 to 7, a player picks two and places one on a conditional card. The other players must guess what the other number is based on the player's decision where they placed their first card.

Venn Diagrams were used to visualize Inner, Outer, Left, Right, and Cross joins. We tested them out using SQLFiddle on our stuco store database,

Datacamp / Codeacademy catch up work.

11/09/2017
SQLfiddle was being a little funny, did Datacamp instead. The Datacamp lesson was not as well designed as the previous ones we did previously. It was basically a review of the querey commands we learned so far.

SQLfiddle: Worked on more advanced queries, slightly annoying. Its like a querey inside a querey

10/23/2017
SQLfiddle using the database we originally had to manually edit the google sheets on. Did things like assigning keys, inserting/replacing data

10/19/2017
Practiced actually using SQL on an online environment. Creating tables, setting primary and foreign keys. And then later doing basic queries on them as well as using modify delete and append commands.

Differential privacy & Apple. What kind of normalization would be the most effecient database if the differential privacy was applied on it? Turns out it depends but 2NF is one that can work. The more tables there are, it would be less effecient for quereying. Assignment: turn pizza database into form that is most effecient.

CH10 HW was due and it was discussed.

Pop quiz --> I realized that I need to sharpen my understanding of certain terms. BCNF form --> removes the errors that can still be present on 3NF, --> more tables. For practice a pizza restaurants data sheet was found and it was BCNF-ed.

Review of 1NF, 2NF, 3NF. Normalization assignment.

Functional Dependancies and Normalization. The point of normalization is to Reduce redundancy, null values, and anomalies. first NF: 
Method 1:get rid of potential multiple things
Method 2: reduce multi-values by turning it into another tuple instead
Secund NF:
MUST be in first NF in order to do second NF.
break down into more
NO MULTI, Everything has its own ID
Third NF:
NO multipvalues
Everything have own IDs
No Transtives
Turn trasitive into its own table.
Trivial FD
A —> A
You can tell what the student id is by looking at the student id
useless because
A,B —> A,C
Don’t need the new A
NonTrivial FD
A—>B
Transitive FD
A —> B, B—> C 
but B-x-> A
and A—> C

CH5 Homework discussion. IS-A relationships.

9/21/2017
Using the STUCO store's poroducts and discounts database, we created two tables and practiced entity relationships.

9/18/2017
We learned how to convert our ER model to relational statements. The last ER diagram that we made from the previous class was used for practice making the relational statements.

9/14/2017
The last question from Jeopardy was finished, and a new card game was used to practice creating ER diagrams. There would be a relationship card, entity card, and an attribute card. These cards would be shuffled and handed out. We are to create an ER diagram using the cards that we randomly receive and find a way to explain it so that it makes sense. This was done a couple times, and the last one we had to take a picture of because we didn't have time to explain it.

9/11/2017
A jeopardy game was played as a sort-of assessment and review. The "examples" section was exceptionally hard as a lot of them required us to create ER diagrams for the situation given, or vice versa. One question is left unsolved.

9/07/2017
(first class) Ch3 homework questions were discussed. The relationships of weak entities that have degrees over two was explained, using Hotel and Hotel Rooms as examples. A vocab/terms game was then played to hone our understanding of key terms and concepts.
