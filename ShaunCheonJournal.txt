A jeopardy game was played as a sort-of assessment and review. The "examples" section was exceptionally hard as a lot of them required us to create ER diagrams for the situation given, or vice versa. One question is left unsolved.

(first class) Ch3 homework questions were discussed. The relationships of weak entities that have degrees over two was explained, using Hotel and Hotel Rooms as examples. A vocab/terms game was then played to hone our understanding of key terms and concepts.
