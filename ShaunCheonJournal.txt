We learned how to convert our ER model to relational statements. The last ER diagram that we made from the previous class was used for practice making the relational statements.

The last question from Jeopardy was finished, and a new card game was used to practice creating ER diagrams. There would be a relationship card, entity card, and an attribute card. These cards would be shuffled and handed out. We are to create an ER diagram using the cards that we randomly receive and find a way to explain it so that it makes sense. This was done a couple times, and the last one we had to take a picture of because we didn't have time to explain it.

A jeopardy game was played as a sort-of assessment and review. The "examples" section was exceptionally hard as a lot of them required us to create ER diagrams for the situation given, or vice versa. One question is left unsolved.

(first class) Ch3 homework questions were discussed. The relationships of weak entities that have degrees over two was explained, using Hotel and Hotel Rooms as examples. A vocab/terms game was then played to hone our understanding of key terms and concepts.
